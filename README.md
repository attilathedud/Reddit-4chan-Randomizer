# Reddit/4chan Randomizer
Do you find hitting the random link too much of a chore when browsing reddit? Are custom subreddit layouts causing you pain and misery? Is using the mouse to click a link literally ruining your life? Reddit Randomizer fixes all that by allowing you to easily use a hotkey to navigate to a random page. It also has the ability to show a loading dialogue and include randnsfw results. Truly one of the most revolutionary extensions to come out this year.

In the spirit of breaking new ground, this extension now allows you to navigate to random 4chan threads! No longer will you have to click on a section and read - simply hit the hotkey and magically the extension will think for you. Simply amazing.
